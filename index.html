        <h2>Few words about me</h2>
        <p>Hi Andy, this is the guy who tries to participate as much as possible in the course! I'm 32 years old and
            live in Casablanca - Morocco. I'm married and a proud dad of a 3 years old son!</p>
        <p>I'm a senior project manager & product owner at a software development company. I'm already familiar with
            Front End development (HTML, CSS & JS) with very very very basic knwoledge of ReactJS. I'm also familiar
            with PHP and SQL. Json responses, API endpoints and Ajax requests are part of my daily routine. I'm also a
            certified scrum master so my job is to coordinate between the scrum team and make sure everybody's happy and
            scrum principles are well applied!</p>
        <p>I've spent 2 years in the UK (London) back in 2014 and I had a great time. Back then, I did a Master's degree
            in international business & Management. Computers have always been part of my life, from the little trojan
            file I used to send to my firends on Messenger to flip their screens to the first website I've built using
            Dreamweaver (back in 2005). Although I studied business out of pure curiosity, I realized it wasn't my
            passion when it came to work.</p>
        <p><strong>Last but not least, I would like to express my gratitude for your time and your effective teaching
                style. I'm eager to dive into the JavaScript part and what's comiong after!</strong></p>
